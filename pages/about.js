          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            Pixo Pixa started out as a birthday gift for my girlfriend and now
            has transformed into a company like no other. My girlfriend was
            always giving me handmade comic books that told the story of the
            adventures we'd gotten into over the past year. They were amazing,
            funny, thoughtful and I couldn't compete. After three years of
            getting my butt kicked when it came to birthdays, I came up with
            PixoPixa. I made a platformer video game starring my girlfriend. I
            made custom game text between each level, to tell a fun and
            personalized story, and the idea for PixoPixa was born. The first
            PixoPixa game was too hard, and still partially a failure, but
            served as proof of concept. As the years went by I honed my
            personalized video game making skills (as one does), until PixoPixa
            became what it is today. Our company is about giving a gift with a
            personalized touch, it's about connecting, telling a story and most
            of all having fun. We aren't a video game company that makes
            persoanlized gifts, we are a personalized gift company that makes
            video games.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a Canadian, living in Turkey. I first came to Ankara Turkey on a
            student exchange, met my girlfriend there and decided not to go back
            home. I studied Physics and Mathematics in university and have
            always enjoyed mathematical logic based problem solving. It was
            about a year after meeting my girlfriend that I learned she takes
            birthdays seriously, like really seriously, like they are a big
            deal. She'd spend a month working tirelessly to make me my wonderful
            birthday gifts, so I realized I needed to step it up. After I
            finished university in ODTU in Turkey, we worked in Egypt for the
            summer, then I started teaching English as a Second Language in
            Ankara Turkey. In the summer of 2016 Ankara Turkey got just a little
            too colorful, so we decided it was time for a change of scenery. We
            moved to Taiwan, and we continued teaching ESL. To describe my
            teaching skills in a single word? "Bad" in two words? "Very Bad".
            Teaching was not for me, by the time I finished my last day of
            teaching my students had gone method in portraying lord of the flies
            (not that they could read it). I needed a contingency plan, bad.
            That's when I started learning coding, and when I realized I could
            make my girlfriend a video game birthday gift, and when PixoPixa
            first reached a drawing board. I've since reached my goal of
            becoming a computer programmer. I have been working on PixoPixa in
            my spare time, but decided now it's time to take it seriously We
            want to share the ability to give a personalized gift to everyone,
            without the need for tens of hours of work. If our company can put a
            few smiles on a few faces we'll consider that a success.{" "}

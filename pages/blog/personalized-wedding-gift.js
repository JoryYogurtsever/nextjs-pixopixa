        <h1>Personalized Wedding Gifts</h1>
        <p>
          When it comes to customs, rituals, nuances and expectations weddings
          have just about every possible twist, turn and trapdoor you can think
          of, and just when you have it all sorted, you find out the bride or
          groom's culture stirred everything up again. We can't promise you
          won't end up toasting everyone with a swear word when the bride's
          brother gave you a crash course in Greek, but we will give you some
          advice so you don't completely bungle the gift giving portions of the
          night.

            For Those attending as guests
          </h2>
          <p>
          When it comes to attending the wedding, outside the bridal party, your
          job is pretty simple, bring a gift for the couple, eat, drink, dance
          and don't make an ass of yourself. Really the only chance you have for
          making a particular mess of things (without the aid of alchohol).
          We've all heard the cliche about getting a bunch of toasters as
          wedding gifts, which is likely why the gift registry was invented. So
          before you lose too much hair over trying to find the perfect wedding
          gift check for a gift registry. If the couple has a wedding website,
          which is very common these days, click through there first, also check
          the emails they sent you if any, or even ask them if they've
          registered for gifts. If you find they have registered, then you can
          simply choose something from the list, and then mark it as purchased
          on the registry, so there are no duplicate gifts, easy peasy! However
          if there is not a registry, don't worry! Let's look at that now.
          </p>
          <p>
          So why the toaster cliche? Is a toaster the perfect wedding gift? Of
          course not. Wedding gifts are traditionally items for the couple to
          use to "start their new life together". So things for the home like
          small appliances and kitchenwares are pretty logical choices to help
          them furnish their home. This is the tradition, but these days couples
          often have been living together for a while before they marry and may
          already have a well furnished home, and unless you give the proverbial
          "wedding china" ie a full set of matching dishes, your gift may just
          not match anything else in their home, and they will end up with a big
          mishmash of kitchenware, though this isn't the worst thing in the
          world, some items can get away with it better than others. A good
          quality cast iron pot or pan need not match anything else in the
          kitchen. The small appliances don't need to match each other either in
          most kitchens, but a gift of 3 of 4 plates or a half dozen pieces of
          cutlery is less libel to jive with anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
          Remember the kitchen is not the only room in the home either, and the
          garden can offer as many options as the house (if they have one). If
          you opt for houseware when choosing a gift, remember not to decorate
          their home. A beautiful set of velvet curtains could be a wonderful
          gift, or a strong stylistic choice they may not agree with. A
          porcelain tiered serving tray is a much safer choice as it is not a
          permanent fixture of the room. There are two other things that are
          important to consider if you are buying houseware as a gift. Firstly
          whatever you buy, choose something of high quality, even if it means
          you must buy a simpler gift or spend a bit more. A wedding is a symbol
          of permanence and gifts should reflect this mindset of the bride and
          groom. Secondly Choose something that is duplicatable or unlikely to
          be chosen by someone else. The other reason the toaster is a cliche?
          Because no one needs more than one toaster. I can do with two sets of
          oven mitts, two, three, or four cooking pots, even of the same size,
          but there is no sensible reason to have two toasters. Keep this
          toaster principle in mind when choosing a wedding gift.
          </p>
          <p>
          Non-houseware: As I mentioned earlier, hosewares were a traditional
          gift, but not everyone needs housewares as a gift these days. The
          truth of the matter is, most young couples these days would prefer a
          gift of cash, the only reason this isn't the norm is because guests
          can feel it's lazy on their part and hosts can feel it's greedy to
          ask. If you don't mind breaking this convention it's usually really a
          win-win. Apart from cash and housewares what can we choose? Are there
          still other options? You need to keep two principles in mind. Firstly
          the gift should be something that will last for a long time, as I
          mentioned above, and second the gift is traditionally something that
          both the bride and groom will use.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you want to go outside of things for the home or garden, there is
          maybe the car? But things for a car would likely look pretty tacky as
          a wedding gift, you can also consider a "His" and "Hers" set, they are
          often in things like towels, backrobes, pillowcases or coffee cups,
          but they may come in clothing like caps or shirts? This could be a bit
          tacky but still generally in the acceptable area. Though it may not be
          a hard and fast rule, getting the bride and groom seperate gifts is
          generally a "risky" if not plain bad idea. The marriage is a symbol of
          union, but separate gifts, might be more symbolic of something else.
          You won't be crucified, but if possible try to avoid going down this
          path. Dispite what I just said, there are however, those who may need
          to buy gifts for the Bride or Groom seperately, let's look at those
          now.

          When should you buy the bride a gift? Short answer, do not buy the
          bride and groom seperate gifts unless you are in the bridal party. The
          exception of course is if you are at a bridal shower which is the
          topic for another article (likely written by someone else). If you are
          the maid of honor or the parents of either the bride or groom, you may
          decide to get the bride a gift. If you are the groom, you probably
          shouldn't worry about getting the bride a gift, just focus on the
          wedding being a success. If you are the parents of the bride,
          something like nice photos of the couple in a fancy frame, or engraved
          jewelery are a good choice. If you are the parents of the groom your
          gift should say welcome to the family, something personal that tells a
          message such as engraved jewelery, photos on pillows or in frames,
          other items for around the house with engraved messages.
          </p>
          <p>
          A gift from the maid of honour to the bride should be something
          personal, remember she chose you as her best friend to share her big
          day with, so your gift should highlight that friendship as well. Try
          to find something classy or thoughtful that sheds light on the long
          history of friendship you've had together. Even managing to find a
          photo from years ago would be a meaningful gift. Play off an inside
          joke or memory you have together. You gift needn't be expensive, but
          it should have thought put into it.

            Personalized Gifts for the Groom
          </h3>
          <p>
          Buying a seperate gift for the groom is not generally necessary. If
          you are a close member of the family like a parent or sibling of
          either the bride or groom and decide to buy the groom a gift, you can
          go for either cheeky or sentimental, depending on the groom and your
          prefernces. You can get the groom something engraved with a nice
          message, such as a watch or flask, or you can get a funnier message,
          or even a semi jokey gift that you know he's likely to appreciate. The
          major gift should always be for the couple, not either the bride or
          groom individually, so if you do get them something, focus on telling
          one message, not on giving something too fancy.

          Even though you emptied out your savings account buying fish or
          chicken options for 500 of your closest friends and family. Even
          though you've already spent 8 months planning details down to the
          pastor's cufflinks, I'm afraid they're still a couple more tiny
          details to consider. Even though you'll be getting a big stack of
          gifts to take home for yourselves, there are a couple you'll need to
          be handing out. The gifts you give are simply a thank you for those
          that helped you both make the whole day possible, and with all the
          stress you've been under, you can probably respect the value of all
          that help, so a little thank you isn't asking much. You should
          planning on giving gifts to the parents of both the bride and groom as
          well as all the bridsmaids and groomsmen.

            Personalized gifts for Bridesmaids & Groomsmen
          </h3>
          <p>
          For the Bridesmaids and groomsmen, it's pretty customary to get the
          same gift for all of them (that is the same item for each bridesmaid
          and the same item for each groomsman). That acctually is great news
          for you, as it saves you from trying to pick out something overly
          personal for each of them. Just play more off gender, and get the guys
          something masculine, like engraved flasks, or beer mugs or growlers.
          You can put their names on them, or just print the wedding date or
          something cheeky like "I survived so and so's wedding". Really the
          best bet is just something nice like a leather wallet, a bottle of
          cologn, a pocket knife, etc. With a simple message engraved on it. For
          the bridesmaids, the logic is pretty much the same, get them something
          like a compact, bracelet, perfume bottle, handbag, notebook etc. with
          an engraved message. You can go with their names, the wedding date, or
          a small personal message for each.

            Personalized Gifts for Parents of the Bride and Parents of the Groom
          </h3>
          <p>
          The other gifts you should get are for both sets of parents. Parents
          have a tendency to love us unconditionally, but it's better to be on
          the safe side and get them something from the heart. If your parents
          were highly involved and helped extensively, or even paid for the
          wedding, you should put some extra effort into the gifts, if they were
          less involved, you can get away with a bit less, the gift is mostly a
          thank you to both your parents. The most important thing is a
          heartfelt card. This is not a good time to sign a halmark card with
          some quote from mark Twain on the inside. You should try for at least
          two or three paragraphs in each card, and put some time into it, this
          should take more than one draft, and people will be reading it. The
          card should be a thank you for everything including raising you, if
          wolves raised you, you probably wouldn't be getting married right now,
          so let's assume that helped a lot. Besides the card, this is a good
          time to choose a gift that presents well.
          </p>
          <p>
          I would recommend a custom gift basket, buy a nice wicker
          basket, fill it with colorful wrapping paper, purple is a great choice
          as it convey's elegance, and fill the basket full of several gifts.
          Some great ideas to include are a bottle of spirit they like, some
          artisan chocolates, a small piece of engraved jewellery for each, such
          as a pendant, necklace, earrings or bracelet for mom and a watch,
          wallet, necklace, cufflinks or pocket watch for dad. Some nice items
          for the bathroom, such as lotions artisan soaps, bath bombs or
          potporri, even perfume cologn or after shave could be a nice touch.
          Something like concert tickets or a spa day (if you think mom could
          manage to get dad to go), would be a great touch. Try some scented
          candles or confectionary like macaroons. You can boost your gift
          basket to the next level by decorating around the gifts with things
          like flowers, shredded wrapping paper, or even pinecones, acorns or
          leaves. It's best to focus on presentation, and make sure you buy
          quality items, the classyness of a gift basket plummets if you toss a
          couple snickers bars in. If you go for only one gift, it may be best
          to get them one thing each, get something high quality, functional and
          engraved, such as some of the items I suggested above.

            Personalized Gifts for the Ring Bearer and Flower Girl
          </h3>
          <p>
          The Flower Girl and Ring bearer are generally the two most discerning
          and distinguished guests at your wedding with nuanced oppinions when
          it comes to ? just kidding, they are generally children. Here you have
          two kids that are helping in your wedding day and it's nice to get
          them gifts to say thank you. While they might just want toys and
          candy, it's best to get them something a bit more classy as it's a
          wedding. A nice necklace or earrings (if she wears them) for the ring
          girl, or maybe a nice journal or notebook are good as they will last a
          long time and she won't out-grow them. For the ring-bearer, he might
          like a compass or notebook. Something like a swiss army knife could be
          good too if his parents approve. Even a watch or wallet could be a
          hit, and all the gifts I've mentioned above can be engraved to give
          them a nice message too look back on many years later as an adult and
          remind them where they got the gifts. It's not a bad idea at all to
          sneak in a bit of chocolate or candy with the gift as well, or even a
          stuffed toy if they are much younger, just try to keep it classy.

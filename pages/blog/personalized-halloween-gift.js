        <p>

          and maybe giving those around you a good scare. Halloween is a fun
          lighthearted holiday, so Halloween gifts should be fun and light
          hearted to match. So what are some of the best gifts to give to those
          around you to know you are thinking about them this halloween? Keep
          reading below as we breakdown the best gifts to share with friends and
          family this halloween! 
          </p>
          <p>
          The best gifts is something you can share with family and friends no matter how far away they are, something you can
          share online and they can show to the world over their social media
          feed. Something that is fun, lighthearted and indesputably has that
          personal touch. For our top choice of a personalized Halloween gift
          you can do no better than one of our PixoPixa Games. We have custom
          Halloween stories sure to scary and surprise and they can be shared
          all over the web with our PixoPixa links. Our games let you tell your
          own story and put your friend's own face in the game as well as the
          face of his greatest enemy. Halloween is a time to have fun, laugh,

          . A second option is personalized Halloween items and decorations for
          the home. Halloween and Christmas have the destinction of being the
          two hollidays where you get to go crazy with household decorations and
          you needn't worry about looking classless or tacky no matter how
          rediculous your house (or person) should look. Houses will be covered
          with fake cobwebs, ghost goblins and gouls, but amid all this terror
          and chaos there is room for a personalized gift. For adults you can
          get personalized door mats, candy jars and window decals, and for the
          kiddos you can get personalized candy bags with their name on it (so
          no one dares steal their candy), or other decorations for around the
          house that have their names on it. If you take a look around the
          internet you are sure to find many halloween decorations you can put
          someone's name on, or you can check with your local buisnesses!

          <h3>Hand Made Halloween gifts.</h3> 
          <p>
          If you want to give a personal touch, Halloween
          is a great holiday for handmade gifts. You can make spooky halloween
          cookies with colorful glaze, make homemade decorations together with
          your kids and let them put their names on them. You can decorate white
          pillowcases to make custom Halloweek gift bags, or just about any
          other hand made item you can think of in the black and oranges of
          halloween. Even filling dried ears of colorful corn and squash into a
          basket can make a lovely halloween gift. If you are getting things for
          children it's much better to hand make things together, Halloween has
          tons of great ideas for arts and crafts, and your kids will love
          helping make decorations, cookies and candy bags just as much as they
          love making scarecrows and carving pumpkins. If you want to give a
          handmade halloween gift to an adult, then it's best to make sure you
          actually produce something of reasonable quality, let's be honest, no
          one really wants the 37 black paper bats you cut out and taped to a
          length of string, they could make something equally mediocre on their
          own. Try to find which talents you have and play to them, and remember
          no matter how nice your Halloween gift is they will only take it out
          for a few days in October, so be prepared for disappointment if you
          are expecting to see it on display at their house for 365 days of the
          year.

          <h3>Halloween events.</h3> 
          <p>
          If you are planning to get a halloween gift
          for your friends or partner, then tickets to a halloween event could
          be a great way to go. There are often events around Halloween, like
          concerts, pub crawls, and octoberfests. There may also be other events
          that are great to take children as well, such as haunted houses and
          pick your own pumpkin farms that open up for halloween. If you decided
          to take your friends or partner to something like a haunted house or
          halloween pub crawl, make sure they are into the halloween spirit or
          it may not be entirely successful. If you want something for someone
          who is a little less into the spirit than you are, there are usually
          plenty of more middle of the road options if you know where to look
          for them. Halloween booze cruise, Halloween baking class, Halloween
          pottery class maybe. Something you might enjoy normally with a little
          Halloween twist. Our fifth and final suggestion? Candy, candy, candy,
          chocolate, candy, chocolate, candy! What is halloween most associated
          with? Horror and sweets, so it's hard to go wrong with renting or
          buying a spooky movie and getting everyone a big bag of sugary
          goodness. There are fancy and artisan options of most types of sweets,
          or you can just win them over in bulk, five or six chocolate bars
          should put a smile on most peoples' faces, served with some candy corn
          or caramel apples and maybe some homemade sugar cookies and you've got
          the holiday solved!

          Remember Halloween is meant to be fun, and that
          goes for you as well, no one should be particularly expectant of a
          gift, so if you give them one it will be a nice surprise that they
          should be grateful for. If you want to check out our collection of

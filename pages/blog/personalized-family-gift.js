        <h1>Personalized Family Gifts</h1>
        <p>
          Choosing gifts for memebers of your family is always daunting to the
          point that some people toss a sprinkling of gift cards and call it a
          day, while others start to dread days like Christmas that are supposed
          to be happy. Let's look at what makes buying personalized and
          meaningful gifts for your family difficult and what we can do to
          always come out of the holidays like a champ. At the end of this
          article I'll breakdown each family member one by one so we can profile
          them in more detail. Why is buying for family so hard? Buying for
          family is hard for two reasons:
          </p>
          <p>
          Firstly you are expected to know them better than anyone. You've known
          your family for either all of your life or all of their life, both if
          your twins! That seems to leave you little excuse to not know them
          better than their friends or partners, and yet often that isn't the
          case. Sometimes it seems like the cards are stacked against you.
          What's worse, even though you know about your family members' hobbies,
          you usually have no interest in them. We generally pick friends and
          partners with similar interests, but family is just a roll of the
          dice. So even though you know your brother spends every weekend
          fishing, once you get to the fishing store and see the thousands of
          products you know nothing about, you realize that you don't know what
          type of fishing he does, what kind of rod and reel he has, and which
          lines, jigs sinkers, floaters, bait, leaders and lines he already has,
          let alone which ones he uses. Fast Forward two frustrating weeks and
          you are buying a gift card for $20 more than you'd originally budgeted
          out of guilt for buying a gift card.
          </p>
          <p>
          The second reason buying for family is hard, is that it doesn't stop.
          Even if you dig into the deepest corners of your soul and dump
          everything you have into this year's christmas gifts, that's only
          bought you 365 days, which of course are scattered with birthdays,
          before you need to do the whole thing again. You can't deal a winning
          hand game after game no matter how good your poker face. So suppose
          you nail the gift giving a couple years in a row, while getting gift
          cards and socks back to show for it. Eventually you lose steam and
          just take the course of least resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
          Let's start looking at some strategies for getting personalized gifts
          that show we know our family as we should, without exhausting and
          demotivating ourselves in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
          The first trick to success: Ask mom! I know this sounds like a
          complete cop-out, but look at it this way. Number one, you don't want
          to get the same gift as someone else, really doesn't it make sense to
          check? Number two, mom usually knows everyone in the family the best,
          she's likely been paying more attention than you about what everyone
          wants and has already. Number Three, you will often get an opportunity
          to collaberate. If you find out mom is buying you brother a new
          fishing rod and reel, you can buy a tackle box and assortment of hooks
          and bait to go with it. This works for everyone, your brother will
          have everything he needs to start fishing, your gift adds value to
          mom's gift and you get the advice you need to make a great personal
          choice. Your mom will also likely have a good idea of everyone's sizes
          and color preferences when it comes to buying clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
          The second trick: Ask some questions to your family member. While it's
          often considered socially unacceptable to ask too pointed questions to
          a partner or friend, you can often get away with a lot more when it
          comes to family, as they are in the same boat as you, and a little tit
          for tat helps you both. You know your family and if you think they'd
          respond poorly to this, then use their discretion, but you can fish
          for direction while still showing how well you know them, for example,
          "Do any of these recent books by [author they like] interest you?".
          You might get a response like, "the ones by that author didn't look
          great, but these books seemed pretty good". Now you've given them a
          gift they acctually want rather than something they feel obligated to
          read now. Obviously a quesiton like "What do you want for your
          birthday" just looks lazy and should be avoided. Another option that
          works for everyone, is take them around to different stores and watch
          carefully what they show interest in. If you spend an hour or two
          walking around with someone looking at things odds are good they will
          even just say "I like this", or "I want to get this someday". Work
          smart, not hard, and if you see something you like, then speak up as
          well, no one loses when everyone wins.
          </p>
          <p>
          If none of these work, or aren't possible, then you'll need to take a
          guess, but you will find it needn't be difficult or daunting. Remember
          gifts for family members should be fun or functional, and bonus points
          for both. A great way to get a personalized gift is to add a message
          or engraving to something you know they will like. If you decided to
          pick out something based on their hobbies or interests/talents,
          imagine it like throwing darts, the more specific the spot you aim for
          the easier it is to miss. If you know they like Sci-fi books, chose
          one you liked yourself, or maybe a collector's or signed edition of
          one of their favorites, rather than trying to guess on a book neither
          of you have read. If they like playing guitar, get a strap if they
          don't have one, or a book of chords and lyrics for a band they like,
          rather than something more specific in purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you want something fun, that gives a personal touch and is sure to
          be a hit, consider one of our PixoPixa custom video games, it gives a
          great option for giving a fun gift and a safe option for highlighting
          the things you know well about them.{" "}

          <h2 id="personalized-gifts-for-mom">Personalized Gifts for Mom</h2>
          <p>
          Buying for your parents is much harder than buying for your siblings.
          At least it seems like your siblings have intrests and hobbies, while
          sometimes it seems your parents just work and stay at home, did they
          forget how to have fun? Maybe a little bit, and it's all your fault!
          Just kidding, of course. While mom loves all the cheap bottles of
          perfume, scarves, gloves and $20 gift cards for Amazon you got her, we
          can do better! Let's dive in, and see how to pick out the perfect gift
          for mom.
          </p>
          <p>
          Give her a chance to unwind, relax and decompress. One of the best
          gifts you can give your mom is a day off from being mom, check out
          local spas to find a perfect package, and be sure to buy the package
          itself, not a gift card for a certain number of dollars. Some great
          options could be a spa package including a massage. A manicure,
          pedicure, or both. A foot massage or cleanse. Or even something less
          mainstream like aromatherapy, or acupuncture if she would be
          interested.
          </p>
          <p>
          Giving your mom the gift of a day to herself doesn't need to be a
          relaxing day at the spa though, there are tons of options of things
          your mom is sure to love, some other great experiences could include a
          wine tasting, a fortune telling, a workshop in something that
          interests her like painting, writing, yoga, pottery or horticulture.
          Maybe a ticket to a dinner theater would be an excelent gift, as would
          tickets to a concert, a river, lake or bay cruise. You can look at
          local events in your area for interesting events, there are usually
          plenty, something like a hypnosis show, dueling pianos, or tickets to
          a comedy preformance could all be a great choice. Classes could also
          be a hit, you can learn almost anything online these days and many
          classes are less than $20, there are also bound to be many adult
          learning classes in your area, toastmasters, painting, dancing or
          pottery all might be interesting choices.
          </p>
          <p>
          You can also give your mother a traditional gift with a personalized
          twist. You can browse for creative customizable gifts on sites like
          etsy or amazon. Getting your mom something for the house or something
          for her to wear with a personalized messages hits two birds with one
          stone, and she's sure to love it. It's important not to give your
          mother a gift for the house or for her to wear that is cheap or ugly.
          When you invest in such a gift, make sure to get something of good
          quality and a good brand name if applicable and also something that
          matches her personal style. Remember if you give her a gift to wear,
          she's almost certain to wear it, and if it's something for the house
          she's certain to put it out, don't be responsible for making her look
          silly or her house look tacky, if you're not confident you can do this
          well, then it's best to choose something less obvious, like a scarf,
          cap or change purse for carry, and coasters, plant pots, key/jewlery
          dishes, cutting boards, cutlery, cups or dishes, doilies, clocks, etc.
          in the case of things around the house.
          </p>
          <p>
          Handmade Gifts for mom, one of the best hand made gifts you can make
          is something that solves a problem for your mom and is a gift of it
          self as well. For example many of the knobs on my mother's kitchen
          cabinets were broken, so I bought a full set of decorate brass knobs
          and installed them all during the night before christmas. So if you
          can make something that looks beautiful for the house and also fixes
          an issue, that's an excellent gift, but not always realistic. Your mom
          probably likes to wear nice things, though the same may not be true of
          your dad. Unless you think you can acctually produce a nice looking
          good quality piece of textile or jewelery, it's likely better to stick
          to things around the home when it comes to making hand made gifts.
          Make sure that whatever you do decide on making, you invest some time
          first into learning how to make it correctly, there are countless
          videos online that detail how to make just about anything, so
          familiarize yourself with them first before you get started.
          </p>
          <p>
          Finding a gift personally for her, if you don't want to take one of
          the approaches above and want to buy a gift, but one that is clearly
          tailored to your mom's interest, then you may face more difficulty,
          but we can still give it a shot. Your mom will probably like different
          scented soaps, creams, bath bombs, lotions etc as gifts. She's also
          likely to enjoy premium specialty products like artisan chocolates,
          coffees, confections, or other gift baskets of the sort. These might
          all be popular choices, but they aren't horribly personal, they are
          safer bets. Something like a book or bottle of wine would show her
          personal taste, but it's also unlikely you will be able to predict it,
          unless you buy the same type of wine she often buys, then it's not too
          much of a gift. A signed, or limited edition of a book you know she
          likes is a better choice. Buying things that match well with other
          things she likes also shows some thought was put in, for example
          coasters or saucers to match her favorite tea cups, gloves to match
          her favorite hat. Some type of DIY kit, like a DIY stencil kit, DIY
          birdhouse kit, or a DIY cactus garden could all be fun options. Maybe
          you've seen her express a talent or interest in something like
          writing, painting, music or gardening, and you can buy gifts to
          encourge that.

          <h2 id="personalized-gifts-for-dad">Personalized Gifts for Dad</h2>
          <p>
          "Dad is there anything you want for your birthday?"
          <br />
          "Maybe a Henweigh?"
          <br />
          "What's a Henweigh?"
          <br />
          "About three or four pounds, depends on the hen" . . . "Hen ... Weigh"
          <br />
          "Dad, I'm serious"
          <br />
          "Hi Serious, I'm dad"
          <br />
          "... you're getting a tie again"
          <br />
          "Purple, please"
          <br />
          Every year thousands of families are afflicted with self-dadbatouge,
          but could this whole situation have been avoided? The answer is yes,
          in this section we will show you how to pick out a perfect customized
          gift that you dad will acctually love despite his abysmally low
          expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
          No one knows what their dad wants for a gift, least of all your dad
          himself. So how do you get him gift he'll love? Odds are your dad is
          about as in tune as the pianos in the Titanic, when it comes to
          current trends.
          </p>
          <p>
          An easy way to get him a gift he'll love is to use this to your
          advantage and just introduce him to something the rest of the world
          already knows about. Get him a year's subscription to Spotify and help
          him set it up on his phone and computer, get him a go-Pro, ear-buds,
          Netflix, or even just download a bunch of his favorite movies on a
          disk or flashdrive, as he probably wants to watch them but doesn't
          know how. An e-reader or external hard drive could also be a good
          choice, just be realistic about how well your dad is likely to be able
          use the item himself. If you get something too complicated for him,
          such that he constantly needs help, of if you get something to make
          social media more accessable for him, then you are responsible for the
          results.
          </p>
          <p>
          Get your dad something he'll likely have fun with, even if he's shown
          no interest in it. Obviously if you know of a specific hobbie or
          interest your dad has, and you can find a gift related to that, then
          that's a better bet, if your dad is always fishing, you can find
          something, or if he likes riding horses, you can pre-buy a 2 hour
          trail ride, but let's assume there is nothing quite that easy that
          comes to mind. Well, you can probably give him something right out of
          left field to play with, such as a soapstone carving kit, an airbrush
          set, maybe even a hot sauce making kit, minature models to paint, a
          train set or an origami book, depending on your dad. It may not be a
          perfect rule, but usually dads will respond positively to a new idea
          of something fun to keep them busy like this.
          </p>
          <p>
          Get him tickets to an event or experience, he'd be interested in. You
          might need to think a bit outside the box here, concert tickets are
          easy enough if there is anything he might like, but you might need to
          get into other territories, consider tickets to things like a river
          boat trip, maybe a sporting event or a special fundraiser. You may
          find tickets to auto shows, boat shows, exhibitions, or activities
          like trail rides, fishing boat trips, guitar workshops. You can
          consider things like lessons, for example in an instrument or
          language, or even computer stuff like photoshop. There are even beer
          festivals and many cities have an oktoberfest celebration as well.
          </p>
          <p>
          Classics with a twist! Getting him a wallet or watch or leather
          notebook could seem unoriginal, but simply getting it engraved with
          his name or a custom message sends the gift to another level. There
          are also companies available that custom print someone's name on
          achohol bottles or flasks, and one company that sends different craft
          beers to your house every month, the world's a wonderful place!
          </p>
          <p>
          The hand-made gift. Designing a handmade gift for your dad can be
          tricky, it should be functional but probably something that serves a
          simple purpose is best. Something like plant or flower pots could be
          good, if he enjoys growing things, and why not add some soil and seeds
          as well. Coasters, placemats or oven mitts if he likes cooking, or
          even a handmade wooden spoon, trivet or spatula. If you like knitting
          or crocheting, you can try a beany, doilies or coasters, or even golf
          socks. Your dad might even enjoy and original "kit" including
          materials and tools, so you can make something together, there are
          many DIY kits of various complexity to chose from online, or you can
          design one your self. You may find that rather than going to a
          ceramics workshop to make something for your dad, it would be an even
          better gift to pay for the two of you to go together. If you do some
          searching you can found countless classes and workshops in your area
          that are likely to be a hit. Some things like different cooking
          classes, pottery, painting, mettelurgy, piano, guitar, songwriting,
          sour-dough bread making, woodworking, or language learning could all
          be available depending on where you live.
          </p>
          <p>
          When it comes to buying gifts for your dad there's no need to stress
          to much. Many dad's would never update their wardrobe if not for gifts
          they get throughout the year, Your dad probably doesn't have terribly
          high expectations.

          <h2 id="personalized-gift-for-brother-or-sister">
            Personalized Gifts for your Brother or Sister
          </h2>
          <p>
          Trying to find a personalized gift for your brother or sister will of
          course depend wildly on their age and interests. Really the best way
          to break this section down is based on age, as I will do below. First
          though, a couple things to note when it comes to shopping for your
          sibling. While your mom and dad will love the hand made gift you gave
          them, just for the effort alone, you're likely to get a lot less
          sympathy from your brother or sister if you tried to make them
          something that ?. well you tried really hard!
          </p>
          <p>
          As a general rule, your brother or sister would probably prefer a gift
          card where they can choose their own gift over a gift that was all
          effort and no success, but does that mean we shouldn't even try? Of
          course not! Here we'll break down some killer strategies to make sure
          your gift is a hit!
          </p>
          <p>
          The first thing to do before shopping for you sibling is to ask your
          mom! As I mentioned above, this is smart for a couple reasons,
          firstly, your mom has probably just been plainly paying more attention
          than you have and has a pretty good idea of what kinds of things your
          brother has been buying lately and what he still wants. Secondly, you
          can make sure you don't accidentally buy the same thing, and thirdly
          you can piggy back off your mom's gifts and buy other things to match
          them. Most things these days are designed with upselling and
          accessorizing in mind, so it's not usually hard to find something that
          pairs well with the gifts your mother already bought. If you have
          other siblings you can also discuss going together with them on a
          gift. That will let you buy something more expensive and nicer than
          either of you could otherwise, and as the saying goes, two heads are
          better than one, certainly true when choosing a gift. Do not however
          "go in on something" with your parents, even if you give them however
          much money you were going to spend, it looks lazy at best, and it
          looks like you didn't do anything and mom just stuck your name on the
          card, at worst.
          </p>
          <p>
          Gift for a sibling less than ten years old. At this age your sibling
          is building fundamental memories they will look back on nostalgically
          for the rest of their life. That said, they won't appreciate the
          nuance and personal touch involved in many of the gifts we've
          mentioned above. To do something really meaningful, this is a great
          age to get them involved in a hobby you can do together. When I was a
          child I had a rock tumbler I absolutely loved, find a creative kit of
          something that a child can have fun with and still see some results in
          at this age, and something you can do together with them to help build
          lasting early memories.

          Gift for a sibling between eleven and eighteen. The tweens and teens
          often seem entirely unpredictable, so how to find something they will
          acctually like? If you're having trouble connecting with your teen
          sibling, you're not the first one this has happened too. You may want
          to try and connect, but your sibling may just want space, if that's
          the case, trying to suggest a middle ground of your interests or butt
          your way into their life is not advisable. The best thing to do is to
          try and find a gift that shows support for whatever things they are
          interested in, and not try and feature yourself too much in the gift.
          Live to fight another day, and know they will thank you for the space
          when they are older.

          Find a gift for your adult sibling. Especially if your sibling is
          older than you, they will likely be ready to appreciate a thoughtfull
          hand made or personallized gift now. You can give them something
          related to one of their interests or something to encourage one of
          their talents. You can find a nice functional object like a watch and
          have it engraved with a personalized message, or you can consider
          tickets to a concert or event that you know will interest them.

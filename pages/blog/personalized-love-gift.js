        <h1>Chosing a Personalized Love Gift For Someone Special</h1>
        <p>
          Chosing a gift for someone you love can be very stressfull but very
          rewarding, as well. In this article we'll give you the information you
          need to find a gift that says what you want to say, and the rest is in
          your court! The first thing you need to figure out, is what do you
          want to say? Let's look at a few possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>

          Firstly, what do you get for someone you like, but you aren't dating?
          Giving someone a gift as a way of asking them out is probably not a
          great idea, and if you do, small and homemade is best, and make sure
          it's accompanied by a message, preferably spoken. The message should
          be your main focus, this is a time when it's best not to let the gift
          do the talking, and something too expensive can seem almost like you
          are trying to buy a date so it's best to be avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
          The love gift for someone you haven't dated too long. If it's still
          early in the relationship, say the first six months, about, then it's
          the perfect time to get something meaningful that will last for years.
          How nice is it to have something you can show people years later and
          say "he/she got me this when we first started dating". You may not
          know your partner too too well yet, so it can be hard to find
          something that matches their style and personality well, your best bet
          for this point in the relationship is something that everyone can use
          and is a safer bet, such as a coffee mug, a scarf, a keychain, or a
          pair of house slippers.
          </p>
          <p>
          Something like placemats, or pillowcases that should match the style
          of a room are not a great bet, as you can easily get them wrong,
          jewlery and clothing can be risky for the same reason. Things like
          socks, gloves, or a scarf are a much safer bet, as are things for the
          home that don't have a huge impact on the overall style, such as
          coffee mugs, books, key bowls, jewelery dish, etc. There is no need to
          buy something too expensive, but do ensure to buy a good quality
          version of the thing you are buying. Let me clarify, don't get
          something expensive like a TV or a diamond necklace, but if you get a
          pair of house slippers, don't buy a cheap or low quality brand name,
          get something nice so they can love it for years.
          </p>
          <p>
          The gift for someone you're in a long-term relationship with. If
          you've been together for more than 6 months, now it's time to take the
          training wheels off. First of all, make sure to be aware of
          reciprocity, being in a relationship doesn't mean you can stop trying
          and avoid all social conventions. If your girlfiend or boyfriend got
          you several wonderful personal thoughtful gifts for your last birthday
          and you get them a $15 Starbucks gift card because "You noticed they
          like coffee", don't expect things to turn out too well for you. The
          name of the game is equal effort, not necessarily equal price, so
          don't feel stressed if you can never compete with a particularly high
          price tag, just put the time into making something nice on your own.
          </p>
          <p>
          When you have been in a realtionship for a longer time, a bit more
          thought should be put into choosing the perfect gift, firstly consider
          occasion, gifts for non-romantic occasions like Christmas, Birthdays,
          etc. should be something you know your partner has wanted but has been
          reluctant to indulge in for themselves. Always keep and ear open for
          "that's so cool", "isn't this beautiful", "I love that", etc.
          attentiveness can make your job 100 times easier. If your partner is
          interested in clothes, encourage them to try it on "just for fun", it
          may turn out that they are a lot less interested once they see how the
          clothes look on them, for this reason, clothing, especially tight
          fitting pieces can always be a risk. Maybe you are thinking "If I'd
          heard them telling me what they wanted, I wouldn't be on your blog,
          would I???", ok, calm down, we'll get through this. Buying them a gift
          they didn't chose gives you the advantage of showing how well you
          understand them, or how much you care, if you do it well.
          </p>
          <p>
          To give a meaningful gift you have three main approaches:
          </p>
          <h2> Best Gifts To Get Someone You love: </h2>
          <p>
          Firstly you can make something nice with your own hands, be aware of
          your own abilities and the time involved (assume most hand made gifts
          that will look half decent, will take a sizable investment of your
          time). If you need to learn a new skill to make the gift, you should
          start on it at least a month ahead of the deadline and expect to work
          hard in that time. Be realistic, make something that is functional and
          subtle, giving someone a giant ugly tie-dye table cloth that they
          don't want to use, but feel guilty about throwing out is the opposite
          of a nice gift. Remember if you are giving a love gift, the gift
          should be about the relationship not (just) the recipient, so you can
          include a message from you, a cheeky nod to an inside joke or
          experience you shared, or even incorparate a photo of the two of you,
          or a reference to where/when you met, feel free to be creative with
          it, that's our aim with a handmade gift after all!
          </p>
          <p>
          Secondly you can buy something that shows how well you know them.
          "Purchased" and "personalized" form a Venn diagram with a sliver for a
          center. Sometimes you walk in a store and spot something and think
          "This is completely Tom!" but really, how often has that happened,
          it's hard to count on such a thing. To pick out a purchased product
          with a personal touch, consider something that shows one of your
          partner's interests or hobbies that they like to do only for fun, and
          chose a gift that encourages it. Remember, we all like sitting around
          watching TV, maybe having a drink now and then, looking and smelling
          nice, etc. We all also have some hobbies and interests, even if we
          rarely act on them, maybe your partner loves writing now and then, but
          never acts on it, here's a chance to show that you believe in and
          support them but buying a fancy pen, notebook or books/courses to help
          them pursue this talent.
          </p>
          <p>
          Can we find something personalized, clearly custom made, but not
          requiring tens of hours of effort? Surly that's a slim slice of the
          cake. Well I have some good news! There are options that do just that!

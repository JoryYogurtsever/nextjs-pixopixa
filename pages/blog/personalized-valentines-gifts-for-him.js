      <h1>Personalized Valentine's Day Gifts For Him</h1>
      <p>
        Selecting a gift for Valentine's Day can be an absolute mine field,
        especially for a couple who haven't been together long. Valentine's Day
        is the one day of the year everyone is expected to wear their heart on
        their sleeve and shower that special someone in their life with love and
        affection. No gesture can go too far, right? ? Well not exactly. Romance
        isn't always one size fits all, some people have a much more
        lighthearted approach while others swoon for grand piano love ballads
        set to candle light and a single long stem rose. Pushing things too fast
        too early in a relationship can lead quickly to that relationship's
        demise, just as much as keeping up barriers, and Valentines Day should
        be romantic, but doesn't give you a free pass to pour out all the
        feelings you've been keeping to yourself. Sounds easy right? Well now
        let's get to the good news, I'll give you a rundown on how to find the
        perfect gift for any man in your life in this article, that are sure to
        be a hit regardless of his personality type or your unique relationship.

          Valentine's day vs. Birthday vs. Anniversary
        </h3>
        <p>
        Very Simply, Valentine's day is for everyone, and your X-year
        Anniversary belongs just to the two of you, since you are certain to
        reach a valentine's day before the big 1 year anniversary, it can serve
        as a great chance to practice in a less pressure trial run. Usually for
        a birthday, as his girlfriend, you can come off shining if you plan a
        nice party and make sure all his friends are able to attend.
        </p>
        <h3 id="buying-for-men">Men are from Mars</h3>
        <p>
        If the two sexes face the same challenges in selecting a Valentine's Day
        gift, then why is this article about buying for him? OK, time to look at
        where gender plays it's part. It's often been touted that men are less
        emotional than women, the truth of course is never so simple, and such a
        statement is more than just misleading. Men are generally noticably less
        successful in reading emotion, subtilty and expressing their emotions.
        Men experience all the emotions women do and a personalized, thoughtful
        gift that comes from the heart can be a highly successful gift for a
        man. This said, while most women would love to receive a delicious
        multi-course homemade romanic dinner from the man in their life, they
        may be disappointed to go through the same trouble and get a lack-luster
        response. A man can be less likely to recognize the effort and thought
        that went into such a gesture, and you could find yourself realizing you
        get the same response from just boiling some spaghetti. Symbolic gifts
        should be more blunt when buying for a man, and you can get extra points
        for practicality as well, a watch with a personal message engraved on
        the back could tick both boxes. If he likes hunting, or fishing, an
        engraved knife could work just as well. If you get him something
        wearable with an image or message included on it, for example if he's a
        man who wears jewelery, most men will acctually appreciate you getting a
        matching item for yourself (so no need to feel guilty). This type of
        gift shows that you are also proud of him and the relationship as you
        are displaying it to others. If your relationship is pretty new, a gift
        that pairs a personalized message with a practical item is generally
        your safest bet. For those who've known their partners a bit longer,
        let's dig a bit deeper and narrow in on your man's personality type.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sensitive-personality">Sensitive Personality</h3>
        <p>
        Does your boyfriend have no trouble explaining how he feels? Is he at
        peace with his weaknesses and not afraid to let you see them? Does he
        leave you notes or send you sweet messages on a regular basis? If you
        answered yes to one or more of these, Then this section is likely for
        you. For this type of relationship you can be much more creative with
        your gift than the others. Even if you're worried he may not fully
        understand the message or effort, you can explain it to him when he
        opens it as long as it's done kindly. A handmade, personalized and/or
        creative gift will be extremely well received.
        </p>
        <h3 id="dedicated-personality">Dedicated Personality</h3>
        <p>
        If Your boyfriend can never spend enough time with you, doesn't mind
        things moving fast, checks in on you several times a day, and can be a
        bit possesive or jelous, then he may be this type. He will appreciate
        symbols of the relationship that are visible for all to see. Photos,
        images, or art around the house, or even better things you can wear all
        day long, something he can carry all day that he got from you like a
        wallet or watch is perfect, and something matching you can both carry or
        wear is even better.
        </p>
        <h3 id="practical-personality">Practical Personality</h3>
        <p>
        Does your boyfriend think in strictly black and white, life is filled
        with problems, and our purpose is to match them with solutions. His head
        is full of maps and lists, he can repair a car and gut a fish, but if he
        tries to say "thank you" or admit he's wrong, his head turns into a
        cracked radiator sputtering antifreeze on the pavement? Congratulations!
        This paragraph is for you. Your gift should be 100% practical, he'd
        probably even be happy with a box of spark plugs for valentines day.
        Best thing to do, focus in on one of his hobbies, and get him something
        related to that. If it's homemade and something you know how to do, such
        as a hand knitted beany or a homemade wallet that would be ideal, though
        you may not get a ton of bonus points for effort. He may not say
        anything about a simple engraved message or image, but he will secretly
        love you for it.

          My Top Gifts For Him For A Perfect Valentine's Day
        </h2>
        <p>
        With the world getting smaller and larger all at once and the consumer
        marketplace spanning the globe, it is becoming harder and harder to find
        gifts that come across as original and personal. While all holidays and
        occasions can face this same difficulty, Valentine's Day can cause a
        unique anxiety as it's a time we are expected to share what's in our
        hearts. Why not buy him a tie and some new socks and be done with the
        whole thing? This will depend on the man you're dating, maybe he's not a
        romantic type and the socks might even be overkill, but if he's the type
        to take the whole Valentine's Day thing seriously, then it's important
        you try to as well. No one tires of hearing the words "I love you" no
        matter how often they are spoken, and no one can fail to enjoy a
        personal gift that comes from the heart, especially on Valentine's Day.
        </p>

          <li value="4">
            Making a gift yourself: It's hard to get more personal than a gift
            made from your own hands, and most people in this day and age are
            realizing the value of a handmade gift is a powerful rival to even
            the best selected consumer goods. To really knock it out of the park
            with a handmade gift you need to keep two things in mind, function
            and ability (that is you own ability to produce it). If you decide
            to go down the route of creating a handmade gift, you must be aware
            of your own abilities. If you have never done video editing before
            and you try to start on making a video gift 1 week before Valentines
            Day the result is likely to be almost unwatchable. Where there's a
            will there is a way, but leaving sufficient time has no substitute.
            Consider function as well, the world's best whatsamajigit will only
            sit on the mantle place for so long before it's accidentally lost or
            discarded. If you make something practical like a wallet or a
            beanie, ensure that it's of a quality suffient for it's purpose as
            well.
          </li>
          <li value="3">
            Purchasing a gift he'll love: Far more common than the hand made
            gift is the hand selected gift. It's possible to show how much you
            care by chosing the perfect gift that shows how well you know him by
            how suited it is to his personallity. This seems easy on the
            surface, but once you get started you may find it's not as easy as
            it seemed. Most people who start down this path end up choosing
            ties, tools, wallets or watches for men, and perfume, chocolates,
            accessories or clothing for women. Even if he loves fishing and you
            buy him a tie with fishing images on it, don't expect the Guiness
            World Record crew to crash through the door and toss the 'girlfriend
            of the year' trophy at your feet. For your store bought gift to
            really come across as personal, you need to consider a hobby of his
            that is not: Drinking, Sports, Wearing Clothes, Shaving, or smelling
            acceptable. A great way to come out a winner in this category is to
            purchase something to encourage him to pursue something you think he
            has talent in. For example if he's a talented muscian but keeps it
            to himself you can get him things for his instrument, things for
            recording, or even lessons to improve. Same goes for other things
            like writing, acting, photography etc. It should be a hobby he finds
            fun and not work.
          </li>
          <li value="2">
            Purchasing an experience he'll love: Valentine's Day is a
            sentimental holiday, that focuses on the experience's you've shared
            together, why not give the gift of more memories? Tickets to a
            concert, play, or other performance could be a great memory. How
            about a local workshop, there are likely to be many couples
            workshops and events popping up around this time if you keep an eye
            out for them. Tickets to go together and do an activity he loves,
            like riding horses, racing go-karts or playing paintball. Remember
            when you choose a gift in this category however, going and doing
            something he loves with him gets you major points, but choosing
            something you like more than him is likely to backfire. If you think
            temptation might get the better of you, then It's best to avoid this
            category. Otherwise, you don't need to choose something you hate, do
            your best to find something just to his side of center for best
            success.
